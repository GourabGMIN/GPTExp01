              "['1 Introduction\\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\\nﬂexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\\nvectors [ MCCD13 ,PSM14 ] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [ DL15 ,MBXS17 ,PNZtY18 ] (though still applied to\\ntask-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [ VSP+17] have\\nbeen directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\\nand algorithms [ RSR+19,LOG+19,YDY+19,LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve\\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\\nof examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many\\nof these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated\\nfor every new task.\\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness\\nof the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus\\nﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then\\nﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [ HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily\\ngeneralize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm\\ncan be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it\\n[YdC+19,MPL19 ]. Thus, the performance of ﬁne-tuned models on speciﬁc benchmarks, even when it is nominally at\\nhuman-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\\nThird, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural\\nlanguage (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number\\nof demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often\\nFigure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad\\nset of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize\\nthe desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within\\nthe forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a\\nmodel would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded\\nwithin a single sequence.\\n3',\n",
              " 'Figure 1.2: Larger models make increasingly efﬁcient use of in-context information. We show in-context learning\\nperformance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a\\nnatural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate\\nimproved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range\\nof tasks.\\nsufﬁcient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing\\nto a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans\\nto seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy\\ndialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same ﬂuidity and generality.\\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1– which in the context of language models means\\nthe model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities\\nat inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1). Recent work [ RWC+19]\\nattempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form\\nof task speciﬁcation: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task\\nand is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\\nWhile it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to ﬁne-tuning – for example\\n[RWC+19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind\\nthe state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of\\nsolving language tasks.\\nAnother recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer\\nlanguage models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [ RNSS18 ], to 300 million parameters\\n[DCLT18 ], to 1.5 billion parameters [ RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19],\\nand ﬁnally 17 billion parameters [ Tur20 ]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream\\nNLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a\\nsmooth trend of improvement with scale [ KMH+20]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and\\ntasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong\\ngains with scale.\\n1In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous:\\nthe method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time\\ndemonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning”\\nto capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner\\nloop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many\\ndemonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model\\nlearns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which\\nwe discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer\\nloop structure.\\n4',\n",
              " 'Figure 1.3: Aggregate performance for all 42 accuracy-denominated benchmarks While zero-shot performance\\nimproves steadily with model size, few-shot performance increases more rapidly, demonstrating that larger models are\\nmore proﬁcient at in-context learning. See Figure 3.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP\\nbenchmark suite.\\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call\\nGPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets,\\nas well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training\\nset. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we\\nallow as many demonstrations as will ﬁt into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”,\\nwhere we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only\\nan instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional\\nﬁne-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to\\nremove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task\\ndescription, and with the number of examples in the model’s context, K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically\\nwith model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and\\nnumber of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no\\ngradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\\nBroadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot\\nsetting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held\\nby ﬁne-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in\\nthe one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the\\nzero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art\\nrelative to ﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proﬁciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-ﬂy reasoning,\\nwhich include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them\\ndeﬁned only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human\\nevaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\\nAt the same time, we also ﬁnd some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This\\nincludes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE\\nor QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3’s strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we\\nhope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.\\nA heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should\\nnot be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\\n5',\n",
              " 'We also undertake a systematic study of “data contamination” – a growing problem when training high capacity models\\non datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such\\ncontent often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify\\nits distorting effects. Although we ﬁnd that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3’s performance on most\\ndatasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inﬂating results, and we either do not report results on these\\ndatasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity.\\nIn addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion\\nparameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings. Broadly, for most\\ntasks we ﬁnd relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap\\nbetween zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models\\nare more proﬁcient meta-learners.\\nFinally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and\\nbroader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3’s characteristics in this regard.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our approach and methods for training\\nGPT-3 and evaluating it. Section 3 presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings.\\nSection 4 addresses questions of data contamination (train-test overlap). Section 5 discusses limitations of GPT-3.\\nSection 6 discusses broader impacts. Section 7 reviews related work and Section 8 concludes.\\n2 Approach\\nOur basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [ RWC+19],\\nwith relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training. Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [ RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly deﬁning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a\\nspectrum of how much task-speciﬁc data they tend to rely on. Speciﬁcally, we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration):\\n•Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of\\na pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset speciﬁc to the desired task. Typically thousands to\\nhundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of ﬁne-tuning is strong performance\\non many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential\\nfor poor generalization out-of-distribution [ MPL19 ], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the\\ntraining data [ GSL+18,NK19 ], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In\\nthis work we do not ﬁne-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be\\nﬁne-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.\\n•Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few\\ndemonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning [ RWC+19], but no weight updates are allowed.\\nAs shown in Figure 2.1, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example\\nan English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving Kexamples of context and\\ncompletion, and then one ﬁnal example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We\\ntypically set Kin the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can ﬁt in the model’s context window\\n(nctx= 2048 ). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-speciﬁc data and\\nreduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow ﬁne-tuning dataset. The main\\ndisadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned\\nmodels. Also, a small amount of task speciﬁc data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot\\nlearning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in\\nML [ HYC01 ,VBL+16] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in\\nthe pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\\n•One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural\\nlanguage description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and\\nzero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans.\\nFor example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical\\nTurk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difﬁcult to communicate\\nthe content or format of a task if no examples are given.\\n6',\n",
              " 'Figure 2.1: Zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, contrasted with traditional ﬁne-tuning . The panels above show\\nfour methods for performing a task with a language model – ﬁne-tuning is the traditional method, whereas zero-, one-,\\nand few-shot, which we study in this work, require the model to perform the task with only forward passes at test\\ntime. We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task\\ndescriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G.\\n•Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given\\na natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for\\nrobustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of\\npre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difﬁcult for humans\\nto understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases “unfairly hard”.\\nFor example, if someone is asked to “make a table of world records for the 200m dash”, this request can be\\nambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and\\neven with careful clariﬁcation, understanding precisely what is desired can be difﬁcult). Nevertheless, for at\\nleast some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks – for example, in the translation example\\nin Figure 2.1, a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction.\\nFigure 2.1 shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French. In this paper we focus on\\nzero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, with the aim of comparing them not as competing alternatives, but as different\\nproblem settings which offer a varying trade-off between performance on speciﬁc benchmarks and sample efﬁciency.\\nWe especially highlight the few-shot results as many of them are only slightly behind state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models.\\nUltimately, however, one-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance,\\nand are important targets for future work.\\nSections 2.1-2.3 below give details on our models, training data, and training process respectively. Section 2.4 discusses\\nthe details of how we do few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations.\\n7',\n",

To study the dependence\\nof ML performance on model size, we train 8 different sizes of model, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 125\\nmillion parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the last being the model we call GPT-3. Previous work [ KMH+20]\\nsuggests that with enough training data, scaling of validation loss should be approximately a smooth power law as a\\nfunction of size; training models of many different sizes allows us to test this hypothesis both for validation loss and for\\ndownstream language tasks.\\nTable 2.1 shows the sizes and architectures of our 8 models. Here nparams is the total number of trainable parameters,\\nnlayers is the total number of layers, dmodel is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the\\nfeedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, d\\x0b= 4\\x03dmodel ), anddhead is the dimension of each\\nattention head. All models use a context window of nctx= 2048 tokens. We partition the model across GPUs along\\nboth the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural\\nparameters for each model are chosen based on computational efﬁciency and load-balancing in the layout of models\\nacross GPU’s. Previous work [ KMH+20] suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters\\nwithin a reasonably broad range.\\n2.2 Training Dataset\\nDatasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset2[RSR+19] constituting\\nnearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufﬁcient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same\\nsequence twice. However, we have found that unﬁltered or lightly ﬁltered versions of Common Crawl tend to have\\nlower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets:\\n(1) we downloaded and ﬁltered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference\\ncorpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy\\nand preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overﬁtting, and (3) we also added\\nknown high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.\\nDetails of the ﬁrst two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix A. For the third, we added\\nseveral curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [ RWC+19], collected\\nby scraping links over a longer period of time, and ﬁrst described in [ KMH+20], two internet-based books corpora\\n(Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.\\nTable 2.2 shows the ﬁnal mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from\\n41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before ﬁltering\\nand 570GB after ﬁltering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets\\nare not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently,\\nsuch that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are\\nsampled 2-3 times.

As a\\nresult, when we train for 300 billion tokens, some datasets are seen up to 3.4 times during training while other datasets\\nare seen less than once.\\nA major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large\\nmodels with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by\\nhaving their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training. To reduce such contamination, we searched\\nfor and attempted to remove any overlaps with the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper.\\nUnfortunately, a bug in the ﬁltering caused us to ignore some overlaps, and due to the cost of training it was not feasible\\nto retrain the model. In Section 4 we characterize the impact of the remaining overlaps, and in future work we will\\nmore aggressively remove data contamination.\\n2.3 Training Process\\nAs found in [ KMH+20,MKAT18 ], larger models can typically use a larger batch size, but require a smaller learning\\nrate. We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size [ MKAT18 ]. Table\\n2.1 shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture\\nof model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network.

              " '2.4 Evaluation\\nFor few-shot learning, we evaluate each example in the evaluation set by randomly drawing Kexamples from that\\ntask’s training set as conditioning, delimited by 1 or 2 newlines depending on the task. For LAMBADA and Storycloze\\nthere is no supervised training set available so we draw conditioning examples from the development set and evaluate\\non the test set. For Winograd (the original, not SuperGLUE version) there is only one dataset, so we draw conditioning\\nexamples directly from it.\\nKcan be any value from 0 to the maximum amount allowed by the model’s context window, which is nctx= 2048\\nfor all models and typically ﬁts 10to100examples. Larger values of Kare usually but not always better, so when a\\nseparate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of Kon the development set and then\\nrun the best value on the test set. For some tasks (see Appendix G) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to\\n(or forK= 0, instead of) demonstrations.\\nOn tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide Kexamples\\nof context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of\\neach completion. For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small\\nnumber of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional beneﬁt as measured on the development set\\nby normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computingP(completionjcontext)\\nP(completionjanswer context), where\\nanswer context is the string \"Answer: \" or\"A: \" and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer\\nbut is otherwise generic.\\nOn tasks that involve binary classiﬁcation, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. “True” or\\n“False” rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what\\nis done by [RSR+19] (see Appendix G) for details.\\nOn tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as [ RSR+19]: a beam width of 4\\nand a length penalty of \\x0b= 0:6. We score the model using F1 similarity score, BLEU, or exact match, depending on\\nwhat is standard for the dataset at hand.\\nFinal results are reported on the test set when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting (zero-, one-,\\nand few-shot). When the test set is private, our model is often too large to ﬁt on the test server, so we report results on\\nthe development set. We do submit to the test server on a small number of datasets (SuperGLUE, TriviaQA, PiQa)\\nwhere we were able to make submission work, and we submit only the 200B few-shot results, and report development\\nset results for everything else.\\n3 Results\\nIn Figure 3.1 we display training curves for the 8 models described in Section 2. For this graph we also include 6\\nadditional extra-small models with as few as 100,000 parameters. As observed in [ KMH+20], language modeling\\nperformance follows a power-law when making efﬁcient use of training compute. After extending this trend by two\\nmore orders of magnitude, we observe only a slight (if any) departure from the power-law. One might worry that these\\nimprovements in cross-entropy loss come only from modeling spurious details of our training corpus. However, we will\\nsee in the following sections that improvements in cross-entropy loss lead to consistent performance gains across a\\nbroad spectrum of natural language tasks.\\nBelow, we evaluate the 8 models described in Section 2 (the 175 billion parameter parameter GPT-3 and 7 smaller\\nmodels) on a wide range of datasets. We group the datasets into 9 categories representing roughly similar tasks.\\nIn Section 3.1 we evaluate on traditional language modeling tasks and tasks that are similar to language modeling,\\nsuch as Cloze tasks and sentence/paragraph completion tasks. In Section 3.2 we evaluate on “closed book” question\\nanswering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model’s parameters to answer general\\nknowledge questions. In Section 3.3 we evaluate the model’s ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot\\nand few-shot). In Section 3.4 we evaluate the model’s performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks. In Section 3.5 we\\nevaluate on datasets that involve commonsense reasoning or question answering. In Section 3.6 we evaluate on reading\\ncomprehension tasks, in Section 3.7 we evaluate on the SuperGLUE benchmark suite, and in 3.8 we brieﬂy explore\\nNLI. Finally, in Section 3.9, we invent some additional tasks designed especially to probe in-context learning abilities –\\nthese tasks focus on on-the-ﬂy reasoning, adaptation skills, or open-ended text synthesis.

We omit\\nthe 4 Wikipedia-related tasks in that work because they are entirely contained in our training data, and we also omit the\\none-billion word benchmark due to a high fraction of the dataset being contained in our training set. PTB escapes these\\nissues due to predating the modern internet. Our largest model sets a new SOTA on PTB by a substantial margin of 15\\npoints, achieving a perplexity of 20.50.

It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but\\nalso to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word\\nﬁlters [ RWC+19] (which ban “continuation” words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to “frame” the task as a\\ncloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired.

Perhaps this is because all models still require several examples to recognize the pattern.\\n12',\n",

Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it\\nis denoted “open-book”. [ RRS20 ] recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well\\ndirectly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive\\nevaluation setting as “closed-book”. Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better\\nand we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in [ RRS20 ]: Natural Questions [ KPR+19],\\nWebQuestions [BCFL13], and TriviaQA [JCWZ17], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in\\nthe closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than\\nprevious closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, ﬁne-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself\\nis also not permitted.\\nThe results for GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.3.

The one-shot\\nresult improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only ﬁne-tunes but also\\nmakes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents [ LPP+20].\\nGPT-3’s few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.\\nOn WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5%\\nin the few-shot setting.

GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of\\nstate-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models.

Nevertheless, GPT-3 appears able to adapt to this\\ndistribution, recovering strong performance in the few-shot setting.\\nOn Natural Questions (NQs) GPT-3 achieves 14.6% in the zero-shot setting, 23.0% in the one-shot setting, and 29.9% in\\nthe few-shot setting, compared to 36.6% for ﬁne-tuned T5 11B+SSM. Similar to WebQS, the large gain from zero-shot\\nto few-shot may suggest a distribution shift, and may also explain the less competitive performance compared to\\nTriviaQA and WebQS. In particular, the questions in NQs tend towards very ﬁne-grained knowledge on Wikipedia\\nspeciﬁcally which could be testing the limits of GPT-3’s capacity and broad pretraining distribution.\\nOverall, on one of the three datasets GPT-3’s one-shot matches the open-domain ﬁne-tuning SOTA. On the other two\\ndatasets it approaches the performance of the closed-book SOTA despite not using ﬁne-tuning. On all 3 datasets, we\\nﬁnd that performance scales very smoothly with model size (Figure 3.3 and Appendix H Figure H.7), possibly reﬂecting\\nthe idea that model capacity translates directly to more ‘knowledge’ absorbed in the parameters of the model.\\n3.3 Translation\\nFor GPT-2 a ﬁlter was used on a multilingual collection of documents to produce an English only dataset due to capacity\\nconcerns. Even with this ﬁltering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially\\nwhen translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we\\nincrease the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training\\ndataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As\\ndiscussed in 2.2 the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based ﬁltering. Although\\nGPT-3’s training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages.\\nThese languages are documented in the supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we\\nalso expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.\\nExisting unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets\\nwith back-translation [ SHB15 ] to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a\\nblend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence,\\nand document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in\\nparticular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make\\nuse of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data.\\nResults are shown in Table 3.4.

This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer\\nin the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot\\nsetting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same\\nway in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another.\\nThis could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format.

We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we\\ntest GPT-3’s ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the\\nletters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3’s ability to\\nsolve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot. Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new\\nwords in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation. We will release the synthetic datasets\\nwith the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models.\\n3.9.1 Arithmetic\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-speciﬁc training, we developed a small\\nbattery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language:\\n•2 digit addition (2D+) – The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from [0;100) , phrased in\\nthe form of a question, e.g. “Q: What is 48 plus 76? A: 124.”\\n•2 digit subtraction (2D-) – The model is asked to subtract two integers sampled uniformly from [0;100) ; the\\nanswer may be negative. Example: “Q: What is 34 minus 53?

Performance decreases as the\\nnumber of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on\\nﬁve digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits. GPT-3 also achieves\\n29.2% accuracy at 2 digit multiplication, an especially computationally intensive operation.

Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of\\nscrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are:\\n•Cycle letters in word (CL) – The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the “=” symbol, and\\nis expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given “lyinevitab” and should output\\n“inevitably”.\\n•Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last characters (A1) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon =\\ncorruption.\\n•Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last 2 characters (A2) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word. Example: opoepnnt\\n!opponent.\\n•Random insertion in word (RI) – A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter\\nof a word, and the model must output the original word. Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.\\n•Reversed words (RW) – The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word.\\nExample: stcejbo!objects.\\nFor each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by\\n[Nor09 ] of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure 3.11.\\nTask performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing\\n23',\n",
              " 'Figure 3.11: Few-shot performance on the ﬁve word scrambling tasks for different sizes of model. There is generally\\nsmooth improvement with model size although the random insertion task shows an upward slope of improvement with\\nthe 175B model solving the task the majority of the time. Scaling of one-shot and zero-shot performance is shown in\\nthe appendix. All tasks are done with K= 100 .\\nrandom insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difﬁcult anagram\\ntask (where only the ﬁrst and last letters are held ﬁxed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word.\\nIn the one-shot setting, performance is signiﬁcantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the\\nmodel can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table 3.10). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these\\ntasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artiﬁcial nature makes them unlikely to appear\\nin the pre-training data (although we cannot conﬁrm this with certainty).\\nWe can further quantify performance by plotting “in-context learning curves”, which show task performance as a\\nfunction of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task\\nin Figure 1.2. We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information,\\nincluding both task examples and natural language task descriptions.\\nFinally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding\\noperates on signiﬁcant fractions of a word (on average \\x180:7words per token), so from the LM’s perspective succeeding\\nat these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also,\\nCL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word),\\nrequiring the model to perform some search to ﬁnd the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require\\nnon-trivial pattern-matching and computation.\\n3.9.3 SAT Analogies\\nTo test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of\\n374 “SAT analogy” problems [ TLBS03 ]. Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of\\nthe SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is “audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to\\nhypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to\\ntemptation”. The student is expected to choose which of the ﬁve word pairs has the same relationship as the original\\nword pair; in this example the answer is “sanctimonious is to hypocrisy”. On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the\\nfew-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among\\ncollege applicants was 57% [ TL05 ] (random guessing yields 20%). As shown in Figure 3.12, the results improve with\\nscale, with the the full 175 billion model improving by over 10% compared to the 13 billion parameter model.\\n24',\n",

The largest\\nmodel achieves 65% accuracy in the few-shot setting, and also demonstrates signiﬁcant gains to in-context learning\\nwhich are not present in smaller models.\\n3.9.4 News Article Generation\\nPrevious work on generative language models qualitatively tested their ability to generate synthetic “news articles” by\\nconditional sampling from the model given a human-written prompt consisting of a plausible ﬁrst sentence for a news\\nstory [ RWC+19]. Relative to [ RWC+19], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles,\\nso trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective – for example GPT-3 often interprets\\nthe proposed ﬁrst sentence of a “news article” as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To\\nsolve this problem we employed GPT-3’s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the\\nmodel’s context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably\\ngenerate short articles in the “news” genre.\\nTo gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional\\nsample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles\\nfrom real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. [ KMB20 ] and Zellers et al. [ ZHR+19]. Generative\\nlanguage models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to\\ndistinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.3\\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles\\nfrom the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles\\nfrom four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each\\nmodel, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed\\nby either the human written article or the article generated by the model4. Participants were asked to select whether the\\narticle was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”, “more likely written by\\na machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”.\\nThe articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected\\nprogrammatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were\\npre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model.\\nHowever, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but\\ninvolved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a\\n160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness.\\n3This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section 6.1.\\n4We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on\\nparticipants drawn from the general US population.

Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator\\nthat an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the speciﬁc facts that the\\narticle titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual\\nphrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed.\\nRelated work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. [ IDCBE19 ] indicates that automatic discriminators like\\nGR O V E R [ZHR+19] and GLTR [ GSR19 ] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human\\nevaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.\\nIppolito et al. [ IDCBE19 ] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe\\nmore tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated\\nby GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated\\ncompletions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial\\nexperiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to\\ncompare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.\\nWe found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was\\n\\x1888%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely\\nabove chance at\\x1852% (see Table 3.12). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3\\ncontinues to produce articles that humans ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human written news articles.\\n3.9.5 Learning and Using Novel Words\\nA task studied in developmental linguistics [ CB78 ] is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a\\nword in a sentence after seeing it deﬁned only once, or conversely inferring a word’s meaning from only one usage.

Though there is some gap between training and validation performance, the gap grows\\nonly minimally with model size and training time, suggesting that most of the gap comes from a difference in difﬁculty\\nrather than overﬁtting.\\nalthough models did perform moderately better on data that overlapped between training and testing, this did not\\nsigniﬁcantly impact reported results due to the small fraction of data which was contaminated (often only a few percent).\\nGPT-3 operates in a somewhat different regime. On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of\\nmagnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential\\nfor contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B\\ndoes not overﬁt its training set by a signiﬁcant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was\\ndeduplicated (Figure 4.1). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as\\nlarge as feared.\\nWe initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap\\nbetween our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a\\nbug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn’t\\nfeasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts\\nresults.\\nFor each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all potentially leaked examples, deﬁned roughly as\\nexamples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when\\nit is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively ﬂag anything that could potentially be contamination,\\nso as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high conﬁdence. The exact procedure is detailed in\\nAppendix C.\\nWe then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean\\nsubset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a\\nsigniﬁcant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be\\ninﬂating the results. The results are summarized in Figure 4.2. Although potential contamination is often high (with a\\nquarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence\\nthat contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method\\nsubstantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.\\nBelow, we review in more detail the few speciﬁc cases where either (1) the model performs signiﬁcantly worse on\\nthe cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference\\ndifﬁcult.\\nOur analysis ﬂagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension\\n(QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English\\n31',\n",

The x-axis is a conservative lower bound for how much of the\\ndataset is known with high conﬁdence to be clean, and the y-axis shows the difference in performance when evaluating\\nonly on the veriﬁed clean subset. Performance on most benchmarks changed negligibly, but some were ﬂagged for\\nfurther review. On inspection we ﬁnd some evidence for contamination of the PIQA and Winograd results, and we mark\\nthe corresponding results in Section 3 with an asterisk. We ﬁnd no evidence that other benchmarks are affected.\\ntranslation. Since our overlap analysis is designed to be extremely conservative, we expect it to produce some false\\npositives. We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:\\n•Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis ﬂagged >90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and\\nDROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difﬁcult.\\nUpon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source\\ntext was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only\\nbackground information and cannot memorize the answer to a speciﬁc question.\\n•German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked\\nas potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the\\nﬂagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual\\nmatches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news.\\n•Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form “ alaok = koala ”. Due to the\\nshort length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for ﬁltering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the ﬂagged\\noverlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set,\\nbut rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g “ kayak = kayak ”. The amount of overlap was small,\\nbut removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difﬁculty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the\\nsymbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance – this is because that task involves\\nremoving non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to\\nmany spurious matches.\\n•PIQA: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point\\nabsolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was\\nreleased after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the\\ncrowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller\\nmodel with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias\\nrather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier. Unfortunately, we cannot\\nrigorously prove this hypothesis. We therefore mark our PIQA results with an asterisk to denote this potential\\ncontamination.\\n•Winograd: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 45% of examples, and found a 2.6% decrease in performance on the\\nclean subset. Manual inspection of the overlapping data point showed that 132 Winograd schemas were in\\nfact present in our training set, though presented in a different format than we present the task to the model.\\nAlthough the decrease in performance is small, we mark our Winograd results in the main paper with an\\nasterisk.\\n32',\n",
              " '•Language modeling: We found the 4 Wikipedia language modeling benchmarks measured in GPT-2, plus the\\nChildren’s Book Test dataset, to be almost entirely contained in our training data. Since we cannot reliably\\nextract a clean subset here, we do not report results on these datasets, even though we intended to when starting\\nthis work. We note that Penn Tree Bank due to its age was unaffected and therefore became our chief language\\nmodeling benchmark.\\nWe also inspected datasets where contamination was high, but the impact on performance was close to zero, simply\\nto verify how much actual contamination existed. These appeared to often contain false positives. They had either\\nno actual contamination, or had contamination that did not give away the answer to the task. One notable exception\\nwas LAMBADA, which appeared to have substantial genuine contamination, yet the impact on performance was very\\nsmall, with the clean subset scoring within 0.5% of the full dataset. Also, strictly speaking, our ﬁll-in-the-blank format\\nprecludes the simplest form of memorization. Nevertheless, since we made very large gains on LAMBADA in this\\npaper, the potential contamination is noted in the results section.\\nAn important limitation of our contamination analysis is that we cannot be sure that the clean subset is drawn from the\\nsame distribution as the original dataset. It remains possible that memorization inﬂates results but at the same time\\nis precisely counteracted by some statistical bias causing the clean subset to be easier. However, the sheer number\\nof shifts close to zero suggests this is unlikely, and we also observed no noticeable difference in the shifts for small\\nmodels, which are unlikely to be memorizing.\\nOverall, we have made a best effort to measure and document the effects of data contamination, and to note or outright\\nremove problematic results, depending on the severity. Much work remains to be done to address this important and\\nsubtle issue for the ﬁeld in general, both when designing benchmarks and when training models. For a more detailed\\nexplanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix C.\\n5 Limitations\\nGPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for\\nfuture work.\\nFirst, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct\\npredecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although\\nthe overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to\\nlose coherence over sufﬁciently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences\\nor paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of\\nGPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed\\ninformally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some\\ndatasets (such as PIQA [ BZB+19]) that test this domain. Speciﬁcally GPT-3 has difﬁculty with questions of the type\\n“If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable\\ngaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when\\nevaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same\\nway in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading\\ncomprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\\nGPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused\\non exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both\\nsample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional\\narchitectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent\\nliterature, which has documented improved ﬁne-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard\\nlanguage models [ RSR+19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks\\nwhich empirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality. This may include ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back\\nand comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then\\ngenerating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a\\nfew of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves\\ncomparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and\\nRACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at ﬁne-tuning\\nthan GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with\\nfew- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”.\\nA more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether\\nautoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the\\n33',\n",

[ RRS20 ] demonstrate beneﬁts of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also,\\nwith self-supervised objectives, task speciﬁcation relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas\\nultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed\\nactions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains\\nof experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world\\n[BHT+20]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a\\ndifferent approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective\\nfunction from humans [ ZSW+19a], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as\\nimages to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY+19].\\nAnother limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efﬁciency during pre-training. While GPT-3\\ntakes a step towards test-time sample efﬁciency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more\\ntext during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime [ Lin20 ]. Improving pre-training sample efﬁciency is\\nan important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional\\ninformation, or from algorithmic improvements.\\nA limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot\\nlearning actually learns new tasks “from scratch” at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identiﬁes tasks that it\\nhas learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that\\nare drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format,\\nto adapting to a speciﬁc style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on\\nthis spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or deﬁning nonsense words\\nseem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although\\npossibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what\\nhumans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training\\nand identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely\\nhow few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.\\nA limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are\\nboth expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of\\nmodels of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation [ HVD15 ] of large\\nmodels down to a manageable size for speciﬁc tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills,\\nmost of which are not needed for a speciﬁc task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible.\\nDistillation is well-explored in general [ LHCG19a ] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters;\\nnew challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\\nFinally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable,\\nit is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in\\nperformance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This\\nlast issue – biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content – is of special\\nconcern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts\\n(Section 6).\\n6 Broader Impacts\\nLanguage models have a wide range of beneﬁcial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion,\\ngrammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But\\nthey also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over\\nsmaller models and increases the difﬁculty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the\\npotential to advance both the beneﬁcial and harmful applications of language models.\\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily\\ngreater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this\\nare numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in\\nSection 6.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section 6.2. We also brieﬂy\\ndiscuss issues of energy efﬁciency (Section 6.3).\\n34',\n",
              " '6.1 Misuse of Language Models\\nMalicious uses of language models can be somewhat difﬁcult to anticipate because they often involve repurposing\\nlanguage models in a very different environment or for a different purpose than researchers intended. To help with this,\\nwe can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying\\nthreats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact\\n[Ros12]. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.\\n6.1.1 Potential Misuse Applications\\nAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples\\ninclude misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing\\nand social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufﬁciently high\\nquality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out\\nthese activities and increase their efﬁcacy.\\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to\\ngenerate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human-written text in\\n3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\\n6.1.2 Threat Actor Analysis\\nThreat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors\\nwho may be able to build a malicious product to ‘advanced persistent threats’ (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced\\n(e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas [SBC+19].\\nTo understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat\\ngroups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did\\nﬁnd signiﬁcant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances\\nof experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated\\nwith media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is\\nnot immediate, but signiﬁcant improvements in reliability could change this.\\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about\\npossible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible\\ndifference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language\\nmodels may not be worth investing signiﬁcant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that\\ncurrent language models are signiﬁcantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for\\n“targeting” or “controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\\n6.1.3 External Incentive Structures\\nEach threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their\\nagenda. TTPs are inﬂuenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular\\namong all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login\\ncredentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\\nEase of use is another signiﬁcant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs.\\nThe outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k\\ntruncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot\\nproduces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the\\namount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to ﬁlter the outputs, which restricts\\nhow scalable the operation can be.\\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will\\neventually develop language models that are sufﬁciently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to\\nmalicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on\\nthis through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.\\n35',\n",
              " '6.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation\\nBiases present in training data may lead models to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content. This is concerning,\\nsince model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways by entrenching existing stereotypes and\\nproducing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential harms [ Cra17 ]. We have conducted an analysis of biases in\\nthe model in order to better understand GPT-3’s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation.8\\nOur goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and\\nbehaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although many other categories of bias are likely\\npresent and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a preliminary analysis and does not reﬂect all of the model’s\\nbiases even within the studied categories.\\nBroadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to reﬂect stereotypes\\npresent in their training data. Below we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings of bias along the dimensions of gender, race,\\nand religion. We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how\\nthey are different in this dimension.\\n6.2.1 Gender\\nIn our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found\\nthat occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identiﬁer than a female one\\n(in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"Thefoccupationgwas a\" (Neutral Variant).\\n83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identiﬁer by GPT-3. We measured\\nthis by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the\\nmodel following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.).\\nIn particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus\\nwere heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and\\nsheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identiﬁers include midwife, nurse, receptionist,\\nhousekeeper etc.\\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the \"The competent foccupationg\\nwas a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent foccupationgwas a\"\\n(Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent\\nfoccupationgwas a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a\\nmale identiﬁer than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"Thefoccupationgwas\\na\". With the prompt \"The incompetent foccupationgwas a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male\\nwith a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias - measured as\\n1\\nnjobsP\\njobslog(P(femalejContext)\\nP(malejContext)))- was\\x001:11for the Neutral Variant, \\x002:14for the Competent Variant and \\x001:15\\nfor the Incompetent Variant.\\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [ RNLVD18 ] using two methods which further\\ncorroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the mod-\\nels ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model\\na context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job\\napplications. `She\\' refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possi-\\nble options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).\\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most\\noccupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to\\nassociate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of\\nall the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences\\nwhere the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All\\nother models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns\\nwith the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers\\nsome preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger\\nmodels are more robust than smaller models.\\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre-\\nselected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature\\n8Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work.\\nSee, for example, [HZJ+19, NBR20, SCNP19].\\n36',\n",

To put these numbers in perspective,\\nwe have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\\n6.2.2 Race\\nTo investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - \"Thefracegman was very\" ,\\n\"Thefracegwoman was very\" and\"People would describe the fracegperson as\" and generated 800\\nsamples for each of the above prompts, with fracegreplaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White\\nor Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that\\nlanguage models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [ HZJ+19], we explored\\nhow race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [ BES10 ] for the words which co-occurred\\ndisproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive\\nwords (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid:\\n-87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).\\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that\\nfocused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in\\nan experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply\\nlooking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reﬂect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to\\na discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated\\nwith a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.\\nAcross the models we analyzed, ‘Asian’ had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the\\nother hand, ’Black’ had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences\\nnarrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and\\nhighlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\\n9We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not\\nrequire the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it didn’t, but other forms of gender bias\\nare likely present and could be studied using different approaches.\\n37',\n",

Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model\\nattributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ+18].\\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this\\nis also extensive [ QMZH19 ,HZJ+19], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions speciﬁc to large\\nlanguage models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for\\nbuilding a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for\\nthese models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative\\nstatements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems [ BBDIW20 ].\\nThus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been\\nshown to have blind spots [GG19, NvNvdG19] but in a holistic manner.\\n6.3 Energy Usage\\nPractical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3\\n175B consumed several thousand petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaﬂop/s-days\\nfor a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure 2.2). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such\\nmodels, as advocated by [SDSE19].\\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of large models - we\\nshould consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the\\nlifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though\\nmodels like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even\\nwith the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or\\nonly a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation [ LHCG19a ] can further bring down\\nthe cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efﬁcient\\nversions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efﬁciency\\nof such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation [HB20].\\n7 Related Work\\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\\nbillion parameters [ JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18 ], 1.5 billion parameters\\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [ SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [ RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\\n[Tur20 ]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\\nincreasing models’ capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\\nconditional computation framework [ BLC13 ] and speciﬁcally, the mixture-of-experts method [ SMM+17] has been\\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19 ],\\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [ Gra16 ] and\\nthe universal transformer [ DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the ﬁrst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\\nthis strategy.\\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\\nRRBS19 ,LWS+20,HNA+17], ﬁnd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1), and we also ﬁnd relatively smooth increases in many (though not all)\\ndownstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling.\\nAnother line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language\\nmodels that are as small as possible. This approach includes ALBERT [ LCG+19] as well as general [ HVD15 ] and\\n39',\n",
              " 'task-speciﬁc [ SDCW19 ,JYS+19,KR16 ] approaches to distillation of language models. These architectures and\\ntechniques are potentially complementary to our work, and could be applied to decrease latency and memory footprint\\nof giant models.\\nAs ﬁne-tuned language models have neared human performance on many standard benchmark tasks, considerable\\neffort has been devoted to constructing more difﬁcult or open-ended tasks, including question answering [ KPR+19,\\nIBGC+14,CCE+18,MCKS18 ], reading comprehension [ CHI+18,RCM19 ], and adversarially constructed datasets\\ndesigned to be difﬁcult for existing language models [ SBBC19 ,NWD+19]. In this work we test our models on many\\nof these datasets.\\nMany previous efforts have focused speciﬁcally on question-answering, which constitutes a signiﬁcant fraction of the\\ntasks we tested on. Recent efforts include [ RSR+19,RRS20 ], which ﬁne-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model,\\nand [ GLT+20], which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time. Our work differs in focusing on\\nin-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of [GLT+20, LPP+20].\\nMetalearning in language models has been utilized in [ RWC+19], though with much more limited results and no\\nsystematic study. More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it\\nstructurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general. Here there is an extensive literature, including\\nmatching networks [ VBL+16], RL2 [ DSC+16], learning to optimize [ RL16 ,ADG+16,LM17 ] and MAML [ FAL17 ].\\nOur approach of stufﬁng the model’s context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also\\nresembles [ HYC01 ], in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model’s activations\\nacross timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training)\\nupdates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks deﬁned at inference-time.\\nFew-shot auto-regressive density estimation was explored in [ RCP+17] and [ GWC+18] studied low-resource NMT as\\na few-shot learning problem.\\nWhile the mechanism of our few-shot approach is different, prior work has also explored ways of using pre-trained\\nlanguage models in combination with gradient descent to perform few-shot learning [ SS20 ]. Another sub-ﬁeld with\\nsimilar goals is semi-supervised learning where approaches such as UDA [ XDH+19] also explore methods of ﬁne-tuning\\nwhen very little labeled data is available.\\nGiving multi-task models instructions in natural language was ﬁrst formalized in a supervised setting with [ MKXS18 ]\\nand utilized for some tasks (such as summarizing) in a language model with [ RWC+19]. The notion of presenting\\ntasks in natural language was also explored in the text-to-text transformer [ RSR+19], although there it was applied for\\nmulti-task ﬁne-tuning rather than for in-context learning without weight updates.\\nAnother approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning\\n[Car97 ], which ﬁne-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for\\neach one. If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the\\nweights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efﬁciency when updating\\nthe weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results [ LGH+15,LSP+18] and\\nmulti-stage ﬁne-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets [ PFB18 ] and pushed\\nthe boundaries on certain tasks [ KKS+20], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and\\nset up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a “natural” broad distribution of\\ntasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate\\na broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation [ TFR+17], human\\ninteraction [ZSW+19b], or active learning [Mac92].\\nAlgorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based\\nbidirectionality [ DCLT18 ], preﬁxLM [ DL15 ] and encoder-decoder architectures [ LLG+19,RSR+19], random permu-\\ntations during training [ YDY+19], architectures that improve the efﬁciency of sampling [ DYY+19], improvements in\\ndata and training procedures [ LOG+19], and efﬁciency increases in the embedding parameters [ LCG+19]. Many of\\nthese techniques provide signiﬁcant gains on downstream tasks. In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive\\nlanguage models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large\\nmodel implementations. However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3’s\\nperformance on downstream tasks, especially in the ﬁne-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3’s scale with these\\nalgorithmic techniques is a promising direction for future work.\\n8 Conclusion\\nWe presented a 175 billion parameter language model which shows strong performance on many NLP tasks and\\nbenchmarks in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, in some cases nearly matching the performance of\\n40',\n",
